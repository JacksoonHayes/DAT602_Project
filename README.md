# Multiplayer Berry-picking Game

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for the BerryBlitz! This project is a multiplayer game where players compete to collect the most berries on a 2D tiled map. The game features turn based gameplay, where players move across a grid, collect berries/items, and interact with each other through an integrated chat system. The first player to collect a predefined number of berries or the player with the most berries at the end of the game wins.
